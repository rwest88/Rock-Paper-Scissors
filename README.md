# Rock-Paper-Scissors
boot camp week 3 and week 7

A unique twist on the classic scenarios.  Seven choices.  Due credit to 'The Big Bang Theory' for adding Lizard and Spock.

Version History:
3/18/18: 
-- two-player option added using Firebase
-- the CSS theme, and five of the weapon buttons, were taken from picoplex.net
-- other buttons were made in MS Paint and Gimp

2/8/18: Second day of Javascript 
-- engine written for 7 possible inputs
-- written in 20-30 minutes after our second lecture on Javascript
-- listens for keystrokes, stats are displayed via alerts (not pretty)
-- needs DOM scripting for better display and interactivity
